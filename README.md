How It Works

    When one hand is visible:

        You can control the mouse (move, click, drag) freely.

    When two hands are visible and one hand is open:

        Your other hand becomes the media control hand.

        Different gestures (fist, pinky, peace, index) will control system volume and media playback.

    👉 Index Finger Only (One Hand)	Move the mouse cursor
    ✌️ Peace Sign (One Hand)	Mouse click and drag (hold down and move)
    ✊ Fist (One Hand)	Single left-click
    ✊ Fist (Two Hands Mode)	Decrease volume
    🤙 Pinky Finger Only (Two Hands Mode)	Increase volume
    ✌️ Peace Sign (Two Hands Mode)	Play the next media track
    👉 Index Finger Only (Two Hands Mode)	Play/Pause current media track
